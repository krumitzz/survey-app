Hey! You... ///|\\\ Now we need to make two important
forms;

1 -> Sign Up Form
2 -> Login Form 

Tip: 
    read and follow the static.css
    to make your card responsive and fit a 360px 
    mobile screen completely

    format --> 
                           LOGIN
                [  email                    ] 
                [  [                     ]  ]
                [                           ]
                [  password                 ]
                [  [                     ]  ]
                [                           ]
                [        Not A Member?      ]
                [          Register         ]
