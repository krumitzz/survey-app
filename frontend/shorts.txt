    1 -> Create forms skeletin in user_form_template.hmtl file

    what i created was it not forms skeleton?

    1 -> Responsiveness is done, start designing form look
    2 -> adjust font size and font
    3 -> add colors, border color just design
    4 -> try making the form(.user-survey) look like a card (it should have a border and maybe a shadow) 

    Key takeaways: know how to make cards and design stunning forms

    5 -> if you managed that, make a sign up and login page using the same techinque
            to make your card responsive and fit a 360px mobile screen completely

check the styling first.
theres no div user survery in my code & am i supposed to pull from amidbidee or from modeskutemi survery app?

have fixed the bug...

you need to;
    1 -> adding padding to the .user-survey
    2 -> add padding to .form-control(input)
    3 -> remove the box shadow from .form-input or make look okay,
         cuz that's not working at the moment
    
    Think of cards or google form cards ("-") 

    styled the button. For some reason i cant scroll and see what the buttle looks like completely bug again tchew
    i'm seeing only half of it
